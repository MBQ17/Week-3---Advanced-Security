Week 3 focused on practical security testing, logging implementation, and final documentation. The main objective was to understand how basic security weaknesses can be identified, 
monitored, and reported in a real-world application environment.

In this week, basic penetration testing was performed using Nmap. Scans were executed on both localhost and target machines to identify open ports, running services, and possible security exposure. 
Different scan techniques such as service version detection, full port scanning, and aggressive scans were used to simulate how attackers gather information during the reconnaissance phase.

To support monitoring and auditing, application logging was implemented using the Winston logging library in a Node.js environment. 
Logs were configured to be displayed on the console and saved into a file (security.log). This helps track application events and provides useful information during debugging and security analysis.

A basic SQL Injection simulation was also tested to demonstrate the importance of input validation. This showed how unvalidated user input can be misused if proper security controls are not applied.

Additionally, a security checklist was created that includes industry best practices such as input validation, use of HTTPS, password hashing and salting, secure configuration, and regular logging. 
These practices help reduce common vulnerabilities in applications.
